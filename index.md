## Corpus of annotated French reflexive verbs

**Authors** : Lucie Barque, Marie Candito and Richard Huyghe

**The project** : building on previous existing classifications, we designed a classification for French verbs bearing a reflexive clitic "se", intended to be precise enough so that we could actually classify corpus occurrences using explicit linguistic tests.


We have designed an [annotation guide](https://frenchreflverbs.github.io/annotation/FrenchReflVerbs_guide_annotation.pdf) during a preliminary annotation phase. We then annotated occurrences of verbs bearing a reflexive pronoun "se", extracted from the [French Treebank](http://ftb.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/).

The [resulting corpus](https://frenchreflverbs.github.io/annotation/releases/ftb-900-v1.zip) contains 900 occurrences, annotated into 13 categories.
